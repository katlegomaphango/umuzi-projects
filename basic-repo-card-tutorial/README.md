# PROJECT: TILDE PROJECT TUTORIAL: SIMPLE REPOSITORY PROJECTS

# Instructions

If you look at the project details you’ll see that a repository has been created for you. Please click on the link and visit the repository page on Github.

For now, you can interact with Github using the user interface. You don’t need to worry about using git from the command line or anything fancy like that. Not just yet anyway. In future projects, you’ll become a Git command-line ninja. For now, we just need you to see how Tilde and Github play together.

## 1. Create a few files

Open up your text editor of choice and create a markdown file. This is a plain text file. Name it important.md.

Write down the answer to the following question:

What is more important: rushing to complete as many cards as possible? Or making sure you fully understand the work? And Why?

## 2. Upload the file

Use the Github user interface (website) to upload your file into the repository. Make sure that you can see the file in Github when you look at your repo’s files.

## 3. Ask for a review (on Tilde)
Now go to your Tilde board and click on the “Request Review” button on the project card. You’ll see the card move across to the Review column.

## That’s all :)
By putting your card in the “review” column you are basically saying that you believe that the main branch of your repo meets all the project requirements and is ready for a competence review.
