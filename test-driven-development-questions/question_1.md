# Question

1. Define test-driven development

# Answer

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the code to define and validate what the code will do. The procedure consists of developing a failed test, putting in place the bare minimum of code to pass the test, and then reworking the code to make it better. This ensures that the code satisfies the required specifications and is continually checked by automated tests.
