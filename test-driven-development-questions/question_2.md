2. If you are following test-driven-development, can you ever skip the “RED” step of the process?

# Answer

No, if you are strictly following Test-Driven Development (TDD), you should not skip the “Red” step of the process. The "Red" step is crucial because it involves writing a test that initially fails, which confirms that the test is valid and that the functionality or behavior you intend to implement does not yet exist.
