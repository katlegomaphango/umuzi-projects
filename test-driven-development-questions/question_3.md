# Question

3. List at least 3 benefits of TDD. Each benefit should be explained in a short paragraph.

# Answer

1. Good Quality Code
   TDD helps us understand how the code will be used and how it interacts with other modules and that leads to better design decisions and more maintainable code.
   TDD encourages writing smaller, focused code units with single responsibilities, avoiding complex, monolithic procedures.
   TDD ensures that only necessary production code is written to pass tests based on user requirements, making the code simpler and more user-centric.

2. Confidentce to Refactor
   Code breaks are a possibility while refactoring code. Therefore, by having a set of automated tests, the errors may be fixed before to delivery.
   When automated tests are utilised, appropriate notice will be sent if breaks are discovered.
   TDD should produce code that is quicker, more flexible, and has fewer problems so that updates can be made with little risk.

3. Early bug detection
   Although developers test their code, manual testing or one-time scripts are frequently used in the database industry.
   With TDD, you gradually accumulate a set of automated tests that you and other developers can run whenever you'd like.
