# Question

4. How can you apply a TDD approach to fixing bugs in your code?

# Answer

1. Reproduce the Bug: 
Ensure you can consistently reproduce the bug to understand its behavior.

2. Write a Failing Test: 
Create a test case that captures the bug and fails

3. Run the Test:
Run the test suite to confirm the new test fails, indicating the presence of the bug.

4. Fix the Bug:
Modify the code to correct the bug

5. Run the Tests Again:
Ensure the new test passes and all other tests still pass

6. Refactor (if necessary):
Clean up the code and ensure it remains efficient and readable, while keeping all tests passing.
