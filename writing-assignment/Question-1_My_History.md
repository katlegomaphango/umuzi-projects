I am Katlego Maphango, the youngest among three siblings, and I was raised by a single mother. I went to Bochabela Primary School in Bloemfontein for my primary education, and it was there that I began playing soccer. I showed considerable skill, leading to an opportunity for a scholarship at a more prestigious school. Regrettably, the scholarship offer did not materialize. Interesting tidbit: During my time in primary school, my friends introduced me to Eminem, whom I now consider the greatest rapper of all time. Since then, I've been captivated by his music.
I went separate ways from my friends when they opted for a different high school than the one I went to because of financial constraints, leaving me in a somewhat isolated position. Making new friends proved to be challenging, given my introverted and reserved nature. However, in 2015, I crossed paths with my best friend, marking a significant connection in my life.
Since I was young, I've harbored a keen interest in technology. My inclination towards the tech world was evident early on, as my mom recalls me disassembling and reassembling my toys. Surprisingly, she initially envisioned my future in building physical devices rather than delving into the software aspect, highlighting my natural curiosity and hands-on inclination.
After completing high school, I pursued a degree in Computer Science with a focus on Mathematical Statistics, I later switched to Data Science. Unfortunately, financial constraints forced me to drop out before completing my studies due to unpaid fees. This decision took a toll on my mental health, leading me to seek the help of a therapist. Overcoming these challenges required a concerted effort to rebuild my life and regain control over my circumstances.
