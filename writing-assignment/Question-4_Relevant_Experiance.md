I pursued a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a major in Data Science at the University of the Free State. However, I faced challenges financially and couldn't complete the degree. It was during my time at the university that I first delved into programming, focusing on the C# language.

In mid-2021 I had to drop out. Following a hiatus, primarily due to mental health reasons I resumed programming in the past year. Seeking further skill enhancement, I enrolled in a 6-month web development course at Codespace Academy. Despite completing the course, I felt the need for additional practical experience.

Motivated to gain more hands-on exposure, I applied to Umuzi, recognizing it as an opportunity to further develop my programming skills and contribute to real-world projects. This step reflects my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth in the field of technology.
