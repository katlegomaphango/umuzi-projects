I believe in my potential as a coder based on my educational background in Information Technology with a focus on Data Science from the University of the Free State. Despite facing challenges and temporarily stepping away due to mental health reasons, I demonstrated resilience by returning to programming. Completing a web development course at Codespace Academy further enhanced my skills, and my decision to apply to Umuzi reflects my commitment to gaining hands-on experience.
I understand the importance of continuous learning, and I am motivated to contribute my programming skills to real-world projects. The combination of my academic foundation, practical training, and determination to overcome challenges positions me to succeed as a coder and make meaningful contributions to the field.
