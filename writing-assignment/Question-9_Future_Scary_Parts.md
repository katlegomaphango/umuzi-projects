My exclusive focus lies in making a mark within the tech industry; it's the only route I see for myself. I made the decision to leave behind a potential football career back in high school, recognizing that tech is not just a preference but a determined choice. This deliberate commitment stems from a deep passion for the field and the understanding that succeeding in tech is not only a career path but a personal mission.
